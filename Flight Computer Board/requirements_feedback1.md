# Materials
- microcontroller
* WHAT MICROCONTROLLER, STM32***, will be decided by Dylan
- MS5611
** REASEARCH DIFFERENT BAROMETERS AND GIVE ME AN ANALYSIS ON WHAT ONE IS BEST, HOW MANY FOR REDUNDANCY
- KX134
** REASEARCH DIFFERENT ACCELEROMETERS AND GIVE ME AN ANALYSIS ON WHAT ONE IS BEST, HOW MANY FOR REDUNDANCY
- BMP280
- MPU6050
** DIFFERENT IMU, AN IMU HAS AN ACCELEROMETER IN IT, 9 AXIS WOULD BE NICE 6 is OK
- indicator LEDs
*SURFACE MOUNT
- buzzer
* GIVE ME A USABLE BUZZER, IT JUST HAS TO WORK
- CAN transceiver
* WILL BE STANDARDIZED BY DYLAN
THE FLIGHT COMPUTER SHALL DO THIS **MUST
THE FLIGHT COMPUTER SHOULD DO THIS *NICE TO HAVE
# Functionality
- get serial monitor output
- transmit and receive CAN messages from all boards on CAN BUS
- GPIO pins for extensibilty (CONNECTORS????!!!!)
- Be programmable from the outside of the rocket, easily accessible
- Shall be able to convert analog sensor values to digital values (instrumention, current/voltage)
